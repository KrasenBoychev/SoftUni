              Tim laid out his vision for what would become the web in a
              document called “Information Management: A Proposal”. Believe it
              or not, Tim’s initial proposal was not immediately accepted. In
              fact, his boss at the time, Mike Sendall, noted the words “Vague
              but exciting” on the cover.

            <p>
                Tim had written the three fundamental technologies
                that remain the foundation of today’s web (and which
                you may have seen appear on parts of your web
                browser): HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The
                markup (formatting) language for the web. URI:
                Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address”
                that is unique and used to identify to each resource
                on the web. It is also commonly called a URL. HTTP:
                Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the
                retrieval of linked resources from across the web.
