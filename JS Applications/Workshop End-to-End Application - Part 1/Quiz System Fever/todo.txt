[x] Create page: when a quiz is created redirect to another page and take the quizId from the ctx properties:
                 in this way I should be able to link the question to the correct quiz 
                 (instead of taking the last created quiz which can cause a bug);

[x] Quiz page: create an object to store the answers of the user -> use the page number from the url to 
               link the answer to the question;
